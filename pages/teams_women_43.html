          <p>Granada Veterans began in February 2018. Where a group of former players had the concern and the need to
            enjoy this wonderful sport again.</br>
            During this year we participated in different tournaments, and we recruited players and former players who
            joined to be part of our project.</br>
            In 2019 we held our first veterans tournament where we had a good response and the call was very
            successful.</br>
            In 2020 we created the veterans' league in which we participate to this day, in the Andalusian
            Federation.</br>
            Our philosophy: "we all play" reinforces friendship and camaraderie and makes them become unbreakable
            values.</br>
            For us, a fundamental pillar is family, since our children, partners and husbands accompany and support us
            at all times.</br>
            Veteranas de Granada continues to add new players permanently, which allows us to enrich ourselves and
            continue enjoying handball every day.

          <p>Friends and fans of Handball,</br>
            We are the Màster Femení OAR Gràcia Sabadell team, and we are beyond excited for our upcoming participation
            in the European Masters Handball Championship in Seville, in the W+43 category! 💚🤾‍♀️</br>

            Our club, founded in 1953, is a true reference in the world of handball in Sabadell and throughout
            Catalonia. The women’s team has a proud history: we reached the División de Honor, the top-tier league in
            Spain, in the 1988-89 season, competing among the best! But what excites us most is that, decades later,
            we’re still enjoying the game together on the court, with the same spirit and even more passion! 💪🏽🎉</br>

            Though we're now over 43, we keep running, throwing, and celebrating like we did in our twenties (or at
            least we try! 😄). Handball runs through our veins, and our green and white colors are always with us. 💚🤍
            Our true motivation to keep playing is friendship, camaraderie, and lots of laughter.</br>

            We’ve also had the amazing opportunity to take part in other European events as part of the Latino Master
            team, alongside great Italian friends—an unforgettable joint venture that has given us unique experiences
            and deep bonds!💛</br>

            We're heading to Seville eager to give it our all on the court, reunite with old teammates, make new
            friends, and why not, dance the night away after the matches! 💃🏽🎶</br>

            See you in Seville with the best energy and loads of great handball! 🤾‍♀️</br>
            Huge thanks to the organizers, the EHF, and Veteranos Sevilla—without them, none of this would be
            possible!</br>
            🙌🏽

            We keep playing, we keep dreaming! 🌟</br>

          <p>From an accidental team to the bigs.. Now here we are as masters. 🤗</br>

            It all started in 1992 when a bunch of little girls enrolled in a basketball course. Our coach tricked us
            into playing a sport we had never heard of.. </br>

            Of course we loved it! </br>

            We strived hard and managed to join the minor league. Our family grew with professional players and we
            joined the bigs.. Then came the second generation players and they also represented our city in handball
            leagues in the name of “Aliağa Belediyesi Spor Kulübü” for years.</br>

            After decades, we reunited in 2016 and founded Aliağa Veteran Handball Team with the support of Aliağa
            Muncipality. We have been playing handball as veterans with the same enthusiasm and joy since then. We
            brought home the championship trophy in every tournament we participated in our country. We enjoy each
            others company and intend to play many more years together, untill we are physically not able to 😊</br>

            See you in June 🤾🏻‍♀</br>

          <p>We are a team of ‘old women’ players who have known each other since childhood. We played from the age of
            10 to 25.</br>

            After more than 25 years, during which time we became professionals at work, mothers and grandmothers, we
            met again to be together and play and have fun. Now we are almost all in our 60s (some of us even older)
            and, despite our age, we continue to play and have fun.</br>

            We are part of a club - the APD HANDROMA - affiliated with the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Handball (CONI).
            For years, APD HANDROMA has been participating in the men's Serie B championship in the Lazio/Campania group
            and in the youth championships. There are also two Masters sections, one male and one female, which have
            been participating in amateur tournaments both in Italy and abroad for several years.</br>

            The club is also very active in schools in Rome to popularise handball in collaboration with the Federation
            and the Sport and Health project.</br>

          <p>
            Esfera Andebol Masters: More Than a Team, a Driving Force The Esfera Andebol Masters Club was founded in
            2012 by a group of former handball
            players who, even after stepping away from top-level competition, weren’t ready to give up
            the game. They wanted to keep running, passing, defending — and above all, sharing the
            passion that had always united them.</br>
            Six years later, in 2018, the family grew: by invitation of these very players, a women’s team
            was born. We started with 14 women, aged between 30 and 50, each with a unique handball
            journey from clubs across Portugal and beyond. Today, we are 22 strong — a true mix of
            talent, with some players having proudly worn the Portuguese national team jersey.</br>
            In our age group, there is no veteran women’s competition in central or southern Portugal
            due to a lack of teams. Competing in the national league — northern zone — becomes
            unfeasible, mainly because of travel costs. But we never sit still: whenever possible, we
            dedicate our time and energy to participating in national and Iberian tournaments, where
            we’ve earned a few podium finishes along the way.</br>
            We train twice a week with the same determination as if we were preparing for an European
            final. We also host themed tournaments that go beyond the game — they’re about
            connection, celebration, and creating lifelong memories. And speaking of memories:</br>
            several clubs often invite us to play against their younger teams. They say we’re an example
            — due to our joy, energy, and passion on the court. We like to think it’s handball that never
            let us go… and we never let go of handball either.</br>
            We play with our heart and soul. For the sport, for the friendships, and for the sheer joy of
            the game. We forget our age — but we never forget why we started: the love for Handball!

          <p>
            We’re a Danish team based near Copenhagen, brought together by our shared love of handball and the strong
            friendships we’ve built over the years. This is the 10th time we participate and some of us have been to EM
            Master around 15 times.</br>

            Many of us have played together since our youth and competed in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd divisions as seniors.
            Today, even though injuries and age have moved many of us off the court, our team spirit is stronger than
            ever.</br>

            We still love going to the European Championships—not just to play and win medals but to enjoy the sport,
            the laughs, and the friendships that have lasted through the years.</br>

            Our bond goes far beyond the court. We know how to have fun, celebrate, and support one another.</br>
            We may be the “Grand Oldies” now, often up against much younger teams—but we show up with experience, joy,
            and team spirit that never gets old.</br>
            Though fewer players on the court these days we’ve for sure grown into the biggest coaching and supporter
            team around! 🇩🇰
