          <p>Granada Veterans began in February 2018. Where a group of former players had the concern and the need to
            enjoy this wonderful sport again.</br>
            During this year we participated in different tournaments, and we recruited players and former players who
            joined to be part of our project.</br>
            In 2019 we held our first veterans tournament where we had a good response and the call was very
            successful.</br>
            In 2020 we created the veterans' league in which we participate to this day, in the Andalusian
            Federation.</br>
            Our philosophy: "we all play" reinforces friendship and camaraderie and makes them become unbreakable
            values.</br>
            For us, a fundamental pillar is family, since our children, partners and husbands accompany and support us
            at all times.</br>
            Veteranas de Granada continues to add new players permanently, which allows us to enrich ourselves and
            continue enjoying handball every day.

          <p>Friends and fans of Handball,</br>
            We are the Màster Femení OAR Gràcia Sabadell team, and we are beyond excited for our upcoming participation
            in the European Masters Handball Championship in Seville, in the W+43 category! 💚🤾‍♀️</br>

            Our club, founded in 1953, is a true reference in the world of handball in Sabadell and throughout
            Catalonia. The women’s team has a proud history: we reached the División de Honor, the top-tier league in
            Spain, in the 1988-89 season, competing among the best! But what excites us most is that, decades later,
            we’re still enjoying the game together on the court, with the same spirit and even more passion! 💪🏽🎉</br>

            Though we're now over 43, we keep running, throwing, and celebrating like we did in our twenties (or at
            least we try! 😄). Handball runs through our veins, and our green and white colors are always with us. 💚🤍
            Our true motivation to keep playing is friendship, camaraderie, and lots of laughter.</br>

            We’ve also had the amazing opportunity to take part in other European events as part of the Latino Master
            team, alongside great Italian friends—an unforgettable joint venture that has given us unique experiences
            and deep bonds!💛</br>

            We're heading to Seville eager to give it our all on the court, reunite with old teammates, make new
            friends, and why not, dance the night away after the matches! 💃🏽🎶</br>

            See you in Seville with the best energy and loads of great handball! 🤾‍♀️</br>
            Huge thanks to the organizers, the EHF, and Veteranos Sevilla—without them, none of this would be
            possible!</br>
            🙌🏽

            We keep playing, we keep dreaming! 🌟</br>

          <p>From an accidental team to the bigs.. Now here we are as masters. 🤗</br>

            It all started in 1992 when a bunch of little girls enrolled in a basketball course. Our coach tricked us
            into playing a sport we had never heard of.. </br>

            Of course we loved it! </br>

            We strived hard and managed to join the minor league. Our family grew with professional players and we
            joined the bigs.. Then came the second generation players and they also represented our city in handball
            leagues in the name of “Aliağa Belediyesi Spor Kulübü” for years.</br>

            After decades, we reunited in 2016 and founded Aliağa Veteran Handball Team with the support of Aliağa
            Muncipality. We have been playing handball as veterans with the same enthusiasm and joy since then. We
            brought home the championship trophy in every tournament we participated in our country. We enjoy each
            others company and intend to play many more years together, untill we are physically not able to 😊</br>

            See you in June 🤾🏻‍♀</br>

          <p>We are a team of ‘old women’ players who have known each other since childhood. We played from the age of
            10 to 25.</br>

            After more than 25 years, during which time we became professionals at work, mothers and grandmothers, we
            met again to be together and play and have fun. Now we are almost all in our 60s (some of us even older)
            and, despite our age, we continue to play and have fun.</br>

            We are part of a club - the APD HANDROMA - affiliated with the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Handball (CONI).
            For years, APD HANDROMA has been participating in the men's Serie B championship in the Lazio/Campania group
            and in the youth championships. There are also two Masters sections, one male and one female, which have
            been participating in amateur tournaments both in Italy and abroad for several years.</br>

            The club is also very active in schools in Rome to popularise handball in collaboration with the Federation
            and the Sport and Health project.</br>

          <p>On February 28, 2013, a group of former BM Triana players met. It was a completely recreational
            get-together, to have a beer and reminisce about the old days, but someone mentioned that veteran teams were
            being formed, and getting back to training and looking for matches with other veterans, even with senior and
            junior girls, since, at the time, there were very few veteran teams, was an idea that caught on.</br>
            Little by little, other girls arrived, from different teams, who had played at different levels, but all
            with the same enthusiasm to return to playing a sport that had given us so much and that, we later
            realized, still had much more to give us.</br>
