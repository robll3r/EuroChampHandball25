          <p>The Sagrada Familia Club has over 40 years of history and was the first sports club registered in the
            Register of Sports Entities of the Andalusian Regional Government in the province of Malaga.</br> Throughout
            its history, it has had a large youth handball academy, as well as teams in both men's and women's national
            categories.</br> Currently, the club is focused on a veteran handball project to offer players who no longer
            compete officially the opportunity to continue enjoying the sport and competition at a higher level.

          <p>The vast majority of us are former players of the Gades Handball Club, who played in the First National
            Division at the turn of the millennium, from the late 90s to the beginning of the 21st century 😅 (like
            everyone else in the championship, we're older than a forest).</br> We were also the dominant players in
            national beach handball at the time, with players in the legendary Vipren Gades and Vipren Chiclana teams,
            as well as on the national beach handball team.</br> But, above all, we are a group of friends who, thanks
            to AJS (Friends of Juan Soriano), remained loyal to handball, hence the name of the team, Veterans Gades
            AJS.

            Veteranos BM P.A.N. Moguer started this crazy thing back in 2016. Upon hearing about a veterans' team,
            especially BM Veteranos Sevilla, people from Moguer, mostly former PAN players, said, "Why don't we keep
            enjoying this?" And so it was, here we are.</br>
            The truth is that being a small town, there are years when it's
            hard to field a team (some get injured, others have a lot of respect for it), but we've been going for 10
            years.
            We've also managed to recruit people from Nerva and some from outside. We believe one of the things that
            gets us hooked is playing in tournaments, and not too close together.</br> We hope to have a great time at
            the
            next European Championship, that there are no injuries, and if we can even achieve something, even better.
            Good luck and congratulations to Balonmano Veteranos de Sevilla for holding this European Championship close
            to home so we can enjoy it.</br>
            Best regards. 💪💪

            Founded in 2012, our club began with a men's veterans handball team, born from a deep passion for the sport
            and a strong sense of camaraderie and competition.
            In 2018, continuing its growth and commitment to inclusivity, the club established a women's veterans team,
            further strengthening its presence in the handball community.</br>
            Driven by a vision for long-term development, the club expanded into youth training, opening both boys' and
            girls' junior teams.
            This important step laid the foundation for nurturing young talent through dedication, discipline, and love
            for the game.</br>
            Today, we are proud to be a solid and respected club within the national handball scene, with over 200
            athletes across both genders.
            With a stable structure, a strong team spirit, and a deep investment in training and development, we
            continue to grow and actively contribute to the progress of handball in Portugal.</br>
            For the third time — and the second in a row — we will proudly take part in the European Masters
            Championship, with 2 male teams and 1 female team, which this year will be hosted by our friends in Seville.
            We’re certain it will be another unforgettable competition, filled with great handball, sportsmanship, and
            reunions with old friends.</br>
            See you in Seville!

          <p>"25 Years of Handball, Beers, and Laughter"</br>

            Twenty-five years ago, a group of young players who had come through the youth ranks joined the Móstoles
            Handball Club Senior team. We weren't the strongest or the most technically savvy, but there was something
            strong that united us: a passion for the sport and friendship.</br>

            We've shared a lot of time, many games, and as the years have passed, the team has become a family. Once our
            senior years were over, we decided to continue as veterans, hoping to compete in tournaments outside our
            city. We've traveled together all over Spain and parts of Europe. Wherever there's a handball tournament,
            we're there, ready to challenge the best, on and off the court.</br>

            For us, handball isn't just a sport; it's an excuse to experience new things. After every match, whether
            it's a win or a loss, we celebrate in the third half. A hearty sandwich and a cold beer are enough for us.
            We chat, discuss the plays, and even laugh at ourselves. Time passes and our bodies no longer respond the
            same, but our feelings remain intact.</br>

            As time goes by, some players have retired and new ones have joined, especially at the European
            Championships, hehe. But every time we get together, whether for a match, a tournament, or a team meal, it's
            as if time has stood still. Handball serves as an excuse to be together, to laugh, to enjoy life.</br>

            We take this great sport very seriously, but we're not just interested in the final score; we care about
            everything that happens before, during, and after the match.</br>

            That's who we are, that's Club Balonmano Móstoles.
