          <p>The Sagrada Familia Club has over 40 years of history and was the first sports club registered in the
            Register of Sports Entities of the Andalusian Regional Government in the province of Malaga.</br> Throughout
            its history, it has had a large youth handball academy, as well as teams in both men's and women's national
            categories.</br> Currently, the club is focused on a veteran handball project to offer players who no longer
            compete officially the opportunity to continue enjoying the sport and competition at a higher level.

            as well as on the national beach handball team.</br> But, above all, we are a group of friends who, thanks

            Veteranos BM P.A.N. Moguer started this crazy thing back in 2016. Upon hearing about a veterans' team,
            especially BM Veteranos Sevilla, people from Moguer, mostly former PAN players, said, "Why don't we keep
            enjoying this?" And so it was, here we are.</br>
            The truth is that being a small town, there are years when it's
            hard to field a team (some get injured, others have a lot of respect for it), but we've been going for 10
            years.
            We've also managed to recruit people from Nerva and some from outside. We believe one of the things that
            gets us hooked is playing in tournaments, and not too close together.</br> We hope to have a great time at
            the
            next European Championship, that there are no injuries, and if we can even achieve something, even better.
            Good luck and congratulations to Balonmano Veteranos de Sevilla for holding this European Championship close
            to home so we can enjoy it.</br>

          <p>
            Founded in 2012, our club began with a men's veterans handball team, born from a deep passion for the sport
            and a strong sense of camaraderie and competition.
            In 2018, continuing its growth and commitment to inclusivity, the club established a women's veterans team,
            further strengthening its presence in the handball community.</br>
            Driven by a vision for long-term development, the club expanded into youth training, opening both boys' and
            girls' junior teams.
            This important step laid the foundation for nurturing young talent through dedication, discipline, and love
            for the game.</br>
            Today, we are proud to be a solid and respected club within the national handball scene, with over 200
            athletes across both genders.
            With a stable structure, a strong team spirit, and a deep investment in training and development, we
            continue to grow and actively contribute to the progress of handball in Portugal.</br>
            For the third time â€” and the second in a row â€” we will proudly take part in the European Masters
            Championship, with 2 male teams and 1 female team, which this year will be hosted by our friends in Seville.
            Weâ€™re certain it will be another unforgettable competition, filled with great handball, sportsmanship, and
            reunions with old friends.</br>
            See you in Seville!

          <p>"25 Years of Handball, Beers, and Laughter"</br>

            Twenty-five years ago, a group of young players who had come through the youth ranks joined the MÃ³stoles
            Handball Club Senior team. We weren't the strongest or the most technically savvy, but there was something
            strong that united us: a passion for the sport and friendship.</br>

            We've shared a lot of time, many games, and as the years have passed, the team has become a family. Once our
            senior years were over, we decided to continue as veterans, hoping to compete in tournaments outside our
            city. We've traveled together all over Spain and parts of Europe. Wherever there's a handball tournament,
            we're there, ready to challenge the best, on and off the court.</br>

            For us, handball isn't just a sport; it's an excuse to experience new things. After every match, whether
            it's a win or a loss, we celebrate in the third half. A hearty sandwich and a cold beer are enough for us.
            We chat, discuss the plays, and even laugh at ourselves. Time passes and our bodies no longer respond the
            same, but our feelings remain intact.</br>

            As time goes by, some players have retired and new ones have joined, especially at the European
            Championships, hehe. But every time we get together, whether for a match, a tournament, or a team meal, it's
            as if time has stood still. Handball serves as an excuse to be together, to laugh, to enjoy life.</br>

            We take this great sport very seriously, but we're not just interested in the final score; we care about
            everything that happens before, during, and after the match.</br>

            That's who we are, that's Club Balonmano MÃ³stoles.

          <p>Our beginning as a team officially dates back to the 4th of February 2010, when several players and
            managers of different teams belonging to the Catalan Handball Federation got together to participate in the
            European Championship organized on the 18th, 19th and 20th of June in the town of Berga (Catalonia).</br>

            Since then and except for the one held in Finland, we have had the honor of participating in all the
            editions organized to date, being able to enjoy the brotherhood between all the teams, excellent atmosphere
            and sporting rivalry, competing in different categories (+45 / + 55). With varying luck in terms of results
            in the competitions held, last year, in the Championship held in the town of Paredes, we achieved the Silver
            medal in the +55 category in the final played against Ukraine.</br>

            We are extremely excited to be able to visit your "magical" city next June, enjoy your well-known
            hospitality and enjoy, one more year, our beloved sport with the rest of the participating teams.</br>

          <p>The Granada Veterans Handball Club began its journey in 2016 as an initiative of a group of fans of this
            sport with the idea of remembering ancient times and promoting the practice of Handball in its Veteran
            modality.</br>
            Granada is a province with a long handball tradition, which caused former colleagues from various clubs in
            the province of Granada to quickly join.</br>
            With the passion for this sport as our standard and with a third time always up to par, we try to leave our
            stamp in each of the tournaments we participate in.</br>
            After our time in several international tournaments such as EMG Turin 2019, EMG Tampere 2023 and Porto 2024
            in which we won the European Championship (+50), we headed to Seville with the hope of participating and
            with the conviction that the friends of Seville will make us have a very, very good time.</br>

              src="../assets/img/teams/OSUNA_MEN_45.jpg" alt="" /></a>
          <p>The members of the current Osuna Madrid Veterans team have largely grown and aged with Club Osuna Madrid,
            since its founding in 1993, and even before. The seed of this Osuna Madrid team was Club BACOAL, founded by
            a group of players in 1991, some of whom are still fighting on the courts of Madrid, wearing (more tightly)
            the Osuna Madrid Veterans Team jersey.</br>

            We started in the early nineties, in the Madrid youth categories, rising from the 2nd Territorial Division
            to the 2nd National Division, and even reaching the 1st National Division in 2002. This experience was only
            enjoyed for one year, and with the help of the municipality of Arganda (since the club's structure at that
            time couldn't afford the outlay that this challenge entailed).</br>

            Unfortunately, the experience was brief and ended with relegation to the 2nd National Division and the
            following year (a player exodus) to the 1st Territorial Division. But we were able to recover and return to
            the 2nd National Division, and since then we have always maintained that category, including participation
            in national promotion sectors, until the arrival of Covid. Throughout this period, we have obviously seen
            the addition and departure of players, but we can say, with a certain pride, that we have been able to
            maintain a fairly stable core, in which the friendship has grown even beyond our love for handball.</br>

            For this reason, and after overcoming the mandatory period of confinement, we decided to take a step back,
            and leave the 2nd National team in the hands of the Club's young players, and we created the new Veterans
            team, with which we continue to enjoy Handball (at a speed appropriate for our physique), and it allows us
            to continue having the excuse to get together, to play... and whatever comes up.</br>

            The C.H. Sant Fost Veterans handball team was founded in 2002 when a group of former players got together to
            play in the league that had been created a year prior. Since then, we haven't stopped participating in the
            league, where we've been semi-finalists several times and two-time cup runners-up.</br>

            Besides the league, we've also traveled to play in tournaments like "Locos de Balonmano," which took place
            in Puerto Sagunto, Seville, Portimao, and various tournaments across Catalonia. In 2018, our team played its
            first European Championship in Innsbruck, finishing in ninth place. Since then, we've participated in the
            European Championship in Granollers and the European Championship in Paredes, Portugal. Next June, we'll be
            in Seville to play our fourth European Championship.</br>

            We hope to continue playing leagues, tournaments, European Championships, and soon celebrate the 25th
            anniversary of the C.H. Sant Fost Veterans team.</br>
            VETERANOS UH AH!!!
