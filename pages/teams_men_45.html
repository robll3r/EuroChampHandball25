          <p>The Sagrada Familia Club has over 40 years of history and was the first sports club registered in the
            Register of Sports Entities of the Andalusian Regional Government in the province of Malaga.</br> Throughout
            its history, it has had a large youth handball academy, as well as teams in both men's and women's national
            categories.</br> Currently, the club is focused on a veteran handball project to offer players who no longer
            compete officially the opportunity to continue enjoying the sport and competition at a higher level.

          <p>The vast majority of us are former players of the Gades Handball Club, who played in the First National
            Division at the turn of the millennium, from the late 90s to the beginning of the 21st century ðŸ˜… (like
            everyone else in the championship, we're older than a forest).</br> We were also the dominant players in
            national beach handball at the time, with players in the legendary Vipren Gades and Vipren Chiclana teams,
            as well as on the national beach handball team.</br> But, above all, we are a group of friends who, thanks
            to AJS (Friends of Juan Soriano), remained loyal to handball, hence the name of the team, Veterans Gades
            AJS.

          <p>
            Veteranos BM P.A.N. Moguer started this crazy thing back in 2016. Upon hearing about a veterans' team,
            especially BM Veteranos Sevilla, people from Moguer, mostly former PAN players, said, "Why don't we keep
            enjoying this?" And so it was, here we are.</br>
            The truth is that being a small town, there are years when it's
            hard to field a team (some get injured, others have a lot of respect for it), but we've been going for 10
            years.
            We've also managed to recruit people from Nerva and some from outside. We believe one of the things that
            gets us hooked is playing in tournaments, and not too close together.</br> We hope to have a great time at
            the
            next European Championship, that there are no injuries, and if we can even achieve something, even better.
            Good luck and congratulations to Balonmano Veteranos de Sevilla for holding this European Championship close
            to home so we can enjoy it.</br>
            Best regards. ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

            Founded in 2012, our club began with a men's veterans handball team, born from a deep passion for the sport
            and a strong sense of camaraderie and competition.
            In 2018, continuing its growth and commitment to inclusivity, the club established a women's veterans team,
            further strengthening its presence in the handball community.</br>
            Driven by a vision for long-term development, the club expanded into youth training, opening both boys' and
            girls' junior teams.
            This important step laid the foundation for nurturing young talent through dedication, discipline, and love
            for the game.</br>
            Today, we are proud to be a solid and respected club within the national handball scene, with over 200
            athletes across both genders.
            With a stable structure, a strong team spirit, and a deep investment in training and development, we
            continue to grow and actively contribute to the progress of handball in Portugal.</br>
            For the third time â€” and the second in a row â€” we will proudly take part in the European Masters
            Championship, with 2 male teams and 1 female team, which this year will be hosted by our friends in Seville.
            Weâ€™re certain it will be another unforgettable competition, filled with great handball, sportsmanship, and
            reunions with old friends.</br>
            See you in Seville!

            <h2><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSUNA MADRID - SPAIN</a></h2>
          </header>
          <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="image fit"><img
              src="../assets/img/teams/OSUNA_MEN_45.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
          <p>
            Hi!.
            The members of the current Osuna Madrid Veterans team have largely grown and aged with Club Osuna Madrid,
            since its founding in 1993, and even before. The seed of this Osuna Madrid team was Club BACOAL, founded by
            a group of players in 1991, some of whom are still fighting on the courts of Madrid, wearing (more tightly)
            the Osuna Madrid Veterans Team jersey.</br>
            We started in the early nineties, in the Madrid youth categories, rising from the 2nd Territorial Division
            to the 2nd National Division, and even reaching the 1st National Division in 2002. This experience was only
            enjoyed for one year, and with the help of the municipality of Arganda (since the club's structure at that
            time couldn't afford the outlay that this challenge entailed). Unfortunately, the experience was brief and
            ended with relegation to the National Second Division and the following year (a player exodus) to the
            Territorial First Division. But we were able to recover and return to the National Second Division, and
            since then we have always maintained that category, including participating in national promotion groups,
            until the arrival of Covid.</br>
            Throughout this period, we've obviously seen the addition and departure of players, but we can say, with
            some pride, that we've been able to maintain a fairly stable core, where the friendship has grown even
            beyond our love for handball.</br>
            For this reason, and after overcoming the mandatory period of confinement, we decided to step back and leave
            the 2nd National Division team in the hands of the Club's young players. We then created the new Veterans
            team. With this team, we continue to enjoy handball (at a speed appropriate for our physique), and it allows
            us to continue having the excuse to get together, to play... and whatever else comes up.
