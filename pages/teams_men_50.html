          <p>
            Founded in 2012, our club began with a men's veterans handball team, born from a deep passion for the sport
            and a strong sense of camaraderie and competition.
            In 2018, continuing its growth and commitment to inclusivity, the club established a women's veterans team,
            further strengthening its presence in the handball community.</br>
            Driven by a vision for long-term development, the club expanded into youth training, opening both boys' and
            girls' junior teams.
            This important step laid the foundation for nurturing young talent through dedication, discipline, and love
            for the game.</br>
            Today, we are proud to be a solid and respected club within the national handball scene, with over 200
            athletes across both genders.
            With a stable structure, a strong team spirit, and a deep investment in training and development, we
            continue to grow and actively contribute to the progress of handball in Portugal.</br>
            For the third time — and the second in a row — we will proudly take part in the European Masters
            Championship, with 2 male teams and 1 female team, which this year will be hosted by our friends in Seville.
            We’re certain it will be another unforgettable competition, filled with great handball, sportsmanship, and
            reunions with old friends.</br>
            See you in Seville!

          <p>
            KIF Kolding is a handball club in Denmark and we have participated in the Masters many times.</br>
            We are a bunch of old boys who still enjoy playing handball and some of the players have been playing
            together for more than 30 years. We enjoy each other's company and look forward to where the Masters is held
            every year and have seen a lot of Europe together.</br>
            The fact that many teams participate in the Masters year after year means that friendships have arisen
            across nationalities and we look forward to seeing our European handball friends again every year.</br>
            Over the years it has become more difficult to get a team together and on our team we are from 50-63 years
            old and the majority of the players are +55 years old, but we want to stay together in the group and
            therefore compete in the +50 years category.</br>
            See you in Seville - another fantastic Masters awaits ahead and we are ready to do our best and look forward
            to many reunions.

          <p>The Granada Veterans Handball Club began its journey in 2016 as an initiative of a group of fans of this
            sport with the idea of remembering ancient times and promoting the practice of Handball in its Veteran
            modality.</br>
            Granada is a province with a long handball tradition, which caused former colleagues from various clubs in
            the province of Granada to quickly join.</br>
            With the passion for this sport as our standard and with a third time always up to par, we try to leave our
            stamp in each of the tournaments we participate in.</br>
            After our time in several international tournaments such as EMG Turin 2019, EMG Tampere 2023 and Porto 2024
            in which we won the European Championship (+50), we headed to Seville with the hope of participating and
            with the conviction that the friends of Seville will make us have a very, very good time.</br>

          <p>HM Ostrava is a veteran handball team founded in 2021 by former players of the historic club Hutní Montáže
            Ostrava, active in the 1980s. The idea was brought to life by Zdeněk Broukal, a former player, and Petr
            Koutný, a well-known coach in Czech handball.</br>
            What started as a friendly reunion match quickly evolved into a serious project. In 2022, a special
            tournament was organized to celebrate Coach Koutný’s 70th birthday, with five veteran teams participating.
            That event marked the rebirth of HM Ostrava, now featuring MEN 50+ and WOMEN 45+ categories.
            In 2023, the team officially registered as Handball Club HM Ostrava, with regular training and the goal to
            revive the legacy of Hutní Montáže - proudly carrying its name, spirit, and a refreshed logo into the
            future.</br>
            We’re excited to be part of Euromaster Handball and look forward to the tournament!

            <h2><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M50 - PORTUGAL</a></h2>

          <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="image fit"><img
              src="../assets/img/teams/M50_PORTUGAL_MEN_50.jpg" alt="" /></a>
          <p>The M50 Portugal team was born in 2017 with the main goal of making a national team with players aged 50+
            to compete in the EHF European Masters, which was to be held that year in Portugal (Gondomar).</br>
            Participation in that competition was a great success, with a 4th place finish and, even more importantly,
            the formation of a cohesive and friendly group of former players who decided not to stop and to continue
            participating in Masters handball tournaments.</br>
            This was the beginning of a true revolution in 50+ veterans handball movement in Portugal, leading to the
            creation of an Association focused on promoting various sports and cultural activities, as well as two
            Masters handball teams in the +45 and +50 age categories.</br>
            The following year, this Association launched the first International Portimão Masters Handball Tournament,
            which has become the largest Masters Handball tournament held in Portugal.</br>
            Still, the origin and main focus of the group has always been the EHF European Masters. The team boasts the
            best track record among Portuguese national teams in the 50+ category, with standout results in every
            edition since that 4th place in Gondomar (2017):</br>
            2018 - Innsbruck - 3rd</br>
            2019 - Turin - 4th</br>
            2022 - Granollers - 3rd (M45), 6th (M50), 8th (M55)</br>
            2024 - Paredes - 3rd (M50) and 4th (M45)</br>
            We continue to successfully organize the International Portimão Tournament in Algarve, now in its 6th
            edition, which has already welcomed some of the most prestigious national and international Masters
            teams.</br>
            We’ve participated in numerous national and international tournaments, always taking the opportunity to
            build friendship and explore new places and cultures.</br>
            But perhaps the most important achievement of all has been the creation of a lifelong group of friends,
            marked by unforgettable moments of camaraderie, joy, and happiness.</br>
            This is undoubtedly the greatest and most meaningful trophy in our ever-growing display case—and the legacy
            that we will never forget.</br>
            At the end of the month, we’ll be again in Seville, a land of brothers, to celebrate once again our passion
            for handball and proudly shout our battle cry:</br>
            M50 PORTUGAAAL!!!</br>
            See you there!

          <p>
            As our crest indicates, we have been together since 2010, united by the motto SUPERBUS MEI SOCII (proud of
            my teammates). Since then, we have trained one day a week, finishing the third half in our own bar.</br>

            We are the oldest club in Andalusia and have competed in the Andalusian League, Spanish Championships,
            International Tournaments and four European Championships.</br>

            Last year, upon returning from Paredes, where the European Championships were held, we decided to embark on
            the adventure of organizing the European Championships in our city.</br>

            And here we are, four days into this blessed madness. We hope that when it's over, everyone has had a great
            time playing our sport, meeting new friends in a wonderful city.</br>

            Thanks to everyone, sponsors, institutions, collaborators, and participants for making this possible.</br>
