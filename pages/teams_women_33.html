          <p>The team was born in 2022, with the support of a great club, and the best coach we could have, from the
            union of some players still active and eager to compete in other areas, and some already retired but eager
            to feel handball run through their veins again.</br>
            It will already be our third European event to which we are very excited and will fully enjoy it both on and
            off the track.</br>
            We know of the great enthusiasm and effort that our Sevillian friends have put into the organization
            of this great event and we are sure that it will be, once again, a great experience.

          <p>Our team is based on friendship.
            We are friends ex-handball players and we really love this beautiful game.</br>
            The team consists of players coming from different cities in Slovakia. It begun here with an idea to make
            the team that will be able to play on some level, hopefully quite high level
            and to be able to compare ourselves with other teams from Slovakia and also from the Europe.</br>
            Last year in European Masters Handball in Parades/Porto we finished at the 4¬∫ place in the category 33+
            competition.

          <p>Most of us had played together when we were young and we have met again over the years thanks to the
            team.</br>
            The team was formed in 2021.</br>
            This is the fourth season that we participate in the Master League of the Catalan Handball Federation.</br>
            Last year we finished second in the league, out of a total of 11 teams.</br>
            In 2022 we went to the tournament organized by Asab in Seville.

          <p>We are a Catalan team from a small town near Barcelona (La Roca del Vall√®s), which just last year we
            celebrated 10 years in the master category ü•≥1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£üéâ </br>
            This season we have been lucky enough to incorporate new teammates who have joined the first team both on
            and off the track (we have some pending review of plays, yes) and who, when proposing to play our first
            Masters Tournament, have been the first to pull the wagon, thank you girls! üíúüíú</br>
            As the category implies, we juggle to combine agendas and find space to enjoy this sport that we are all so
            passionate about, and we are tremendously excited to be with you in Seville!</br>
            This year we are launching a mascot with a casual resemblance üòúü§£ that we hope will arrive at the end of
            the season and take us there!

          <p>We are Scandi Stars, former team FIF/H√òJ.
            This is the 3rd time we have participated in the EHF masters. The first time was in 2023 when we won and
            last year we came 3rd.</br>

            We changed the name to Scandi Stars because we had both danish, swedish and Norwegian players on the team we
            are looking forward to participate again.</br>

            Some of us goes back to when we played handball as children, and have known eachother for 20 + years. almost
            every one did Play professional, and we playes against eachother on different teams as well. </br>

            Now we Are old and we Play for the magic of handball and friendship . A lot of us are mothers, and last year
            one of the players took along her husband and 11 weeks Young baby boy! for the love of the sport is
            important for us.
