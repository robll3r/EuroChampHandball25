            from 12 years old to senior. </br>

            known
            each other since childhood, because many of us played together or against each other 50 years ago.

            It began its journey in 1995 with meetings and friendly matches organized by former club players. In 2005,
            the club's veterans legally established themselves as an independent entity and moved to the neighboring
            town of Matadepera, where the Matadepera Veterans Handball Club was founded, comprised solely of one
            handball team, the masters team.</br>

            Handbol Veterans Matadepera quickly established itself as one of the pioneering clubs in the Catalan Masters
            League of the Catalan Handball Federation (FCH). Throughout its history, the club was crowned champion of
            the Catalan Masters League twice: in the 2013-14 and 2015-16 seasons, and also finished runner-up in the
            2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons. He also won the Catalan Masters Cup in the 2007-08 season.</br>

            At the international level, Handbol Veterans Matadepera participated in more than 10 editions of the
            European Masters Handball Championship organized by the EHF (European Masters Handball Championship).</br>

            The club also participated in several national and international friendly tournaments, one of the most
            important being the Ciudad de Sevilla International Tournament, where it always competed in the +35
            category.</br>

            Throughout its recent history, Handbol Veterans Matadepera was primarily comprised of former Handbol
            Terrassa players, which fostered a relationship of friendship and collaboration between the two
            entities.</br>

            This relationship led, in 2021, to a unanimous agreement for all Handbol Veterans Matadepera members to join
            Club Handbol Terrassa.</br>

            Thus, starting in the 2021-2022 season, the veteran team began its journey as Handbol Terrassa Veterans and
            began competing in the Catalan Masters League of the Catalan Handball Federation and other competitions,
            marking the beginning of a new era for veteran handball in the city.

            Based on the successful experiences, the EHF decided to organize the Masters European Championships every
            two years, and then from 2005, is organized yearly.</br>
            With several well-known former national team players in the team, we participated in all the
            European Championships with great success. At the European Championships, in several age groups, we won a
            total of 15 pcs gold, 8 pcs silver and 4 pcs bronze medals.

          <p>Our beginning as a team officially dates back to the 4th of February 2010, when several players and
            managers of different teams belonging to the Catalan Handball Federation got together to participate in the
            European Championship organized on the 18th, 19th and 20th of June in the town of Berga (Catalonia).</br>

            Since then and except for the one held in Finland, we have had the honor of participating in all the
            editions organized to date, being able to enjoy the brotherhood between all the teams, excellent atmosphere
            and sporting rivalry, competing in different categories (+45 / + 55). With varying luck in terms of results
            in the competitions held, last year, in the Championship held in the town of Paredes, we achieved the Silver
            medal in the +55 category in the final played against Ukraine.</br>

            We are extremely excited to be able to visit your "magical" city next June, enjoy your well-known
            hospitality and enjoy, one more year, our beloved sport with the rest of the participating teams.</br>
