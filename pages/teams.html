          <p>The team was born in 2022, with the support of a great club, and the best coach we could have, from the
            union of some players still active and eager to compete in other areas, and some already retired but eager
            to feel handball run through their veins again.</br>
            It will already be our third European event to which we are very excited and will fully enjoy it both on and
            off the track.</br>
            We know of the great enthusiasm and effort that our Sevillian friends have put into the organization
            of this great event and we are sure that it will be, once again, a great experience.

          <p>Our team is based on friendship.
            We are friends - ex-handball players and we really love this beautiful game.</br>
            The team consists of players coming from different cities in Slovakia. It begun here with an idea to make
            the team that will be able to play on some level, hopefully quite high level
            and to be able to compare ourselves with other teams from Slovakia and also from the Europe.</br>
            Last year in European Masters Handball in Parades/Porto we finished at the 4. place in the category 33+
            competition.

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to meet a team that shows that in handball, as in life, experience is a
            degree (and cold beer, a great incentive). Since 2018, the guys from CD Másters Balonmano Almería have shown
            that passion for the sport has no age... but it is a good excuse to travel, sweat a little and celebrate a
            lot. </br>

            Arriving from different lands in the sunny province of Almería, this group of brave people decided to join
            forces, leaving speed and youthful reflexes aside to concentrate on what is important: enjoying handball
            (and what comes after the game). What better way to keep sporting passion alive than turning each
            championship into an adventure among friends?</br>

            Now heading to the European Championship:
            With luggage full of hope, knee pads (just in case) and some ibuprofen, we headed out to conquer Europe. But
            don't worry, our priorities are clear: </br>

            1. Make friends in every game. </br>
            2. Compete as if we were young (and survive as veterans). </br>
            3. Leave a good taste in your mouth... and bring good stories to tell in Almería! </br>

            In short, the CD Masters Balonmano Almería are more than a team: we are a family, a group of dreamers and,
            above all, a group of friends who never miss an opportunity to show that handball and fun do not understand
            age. See you on the court (or in the third period)!

          <p>Most of us had played together when we were young and we have met again over the years thanks to the
            team.</br>
            The team was formed in 2021.</br>
            This is the fourth season that we participate in the Master League of the Catalan Handball Federation.</br>
            Last year we finished second in the league, out of a total of 11 teams.</br>
            In 2022 we went to the tournament organized by Asab in Seville.

          <p>In 1981, a group of friends from Banyoles founded the Banyoles Handbol Club, and in the absence of a
            pavilion they also built the playing court in the courtyard of the city institute.</br>
            40 years later, in 2021, the Masters team was formed for the first time to be able to continue enjoying
            handball, with players from the club's entire life but also bringing together people from other clubs in
            Girona where that Masters team did not exist.</br>
            In its first participation in the Catalan Masters League, the team won the title.

          <p>Granada Veterans began in February 2018. Where a group of former players had the concern and the need to
            enjoy this wonderful sport again.</br>
            During this year we participated in different tournaments, and we recruited players and former players who
            joined to be part of our project.</br>
            In 2019 we held our first veterans tournament where we had a good response and the call was very successful.
            In 2020 we created the veterans' league in which we participate to this day, in the Andalusian Federation.
            Our philosophy: "we all play" reinforces friendship and camaraderie and makes them become unbreakable
            values.</br>
            For us, a fundamental pillar is family, since our children, partners and husbands accompany and support us
            at all times.
            Veteranas de Granada continues to add new players permanently, which allows us to enrich ourselves and
            continue enjoying handball every day.

          <p>The Granada Veterans Handball Club began its journey in 2016 as an initiative of a group of fans of this
            sport with the idea of remembering ancient times and promoting the practice of Handball in its Veteran
            modality.</br>
            Granada is a province with a long handball tradition, which caused former colleagues from various clubs in
            the province of Granada to quickly join.</br>
            With the passion for this sport as our standard and with a third time always up to par, we try to leave our
            stamp in each of the tournaments we participate in.</br>
            After our time in several international tournaments such as EMG Turin 2019, EMG Tampere 2023 and Porto 2024
            in which we won the European Championship (+50), we headed to Seville with the hope of participating and
            with the conviction that the friends of Seville will make us have a very, very good time.

          <p>We are a Catalan team from a small town near Barcelona (La Roca del Vallès), which just last year we
            celebrated 10 years in the master category 🥳1️⃣0️⃣🎉 </br>
            This season we have been lucky enough to incorporate new teammates who have joined the first team both on
            and off the track (we have some pending review of plays, yes) and who, when proposing to play our first
            Masters Tournament, have been the first to pull the wagon, thank you girls! 💜💜</br>
            As the category implies, we juggle to combine agendas and find space to enjoy this sport that we are all so
            passionate about, and we are tremendously excited to be with you in Seville!</br>
            This year we are launching a mascot with a casual resemblance 😜🤣 that we hope will arrive at the end of
            the season and take us there!

          <p>The idea was to create a space where players, who were no longer competing at the federated level, could
            continue enjoying handball, maintain their physical fitness and, above all, strengthen bonds of friendship.

            The adventures of the Veterans section began in March 2010 when a series of friendlies were scheduled by
            fifteen former players of the club, thanks to the announcement by the Galician Federation of the possibility
            of creating the Galician Championship through the concentration sector system.</br>

            The first result was a 23-19 victory against Balonmán Ourense de Veteranos.

            As the years passed, the team gained experience in competing in concentration tournaments, becoming a
            benchmark when it came to receiving invitations from other Galician, Asturian and Portuguese teams to
            participate in tournaments in their towns. </br>

            In 2012, the team achieved its first sporting success by winning the Castrillón tournament in Asturias,
            which would be followed by others in Lugo or Bueu and podium positions in Corvera or Ourense.

            The arrival of the pandemic truncated the stability that was achieved over time and at the moment the
            competitive level of the team is being resumed (the fun was never lost) achieving, in recent seasons, once
            again, podium positions in Ribadavia.</br>

            The players and former players are part of the different generations of youth players who have passed
            through the Club and the veterans include in our team, for the dispute of this tournament, all the former
            players who cannot form their own team and want to enjoy the event... Fura Lalín!

          <p>The handball masters (veteran athletes) movement in Ukraine has a rich history and
            remarkable achievements. Today, its most prominent representative is the Handball
            Masters Team "Odesa", whose motto is: Game not over!</br>

            The team consists of athletes aged 55+, most of whom were former players of the
            professional handball team SKA-Odesa. Today, they represent various
            professions—teachers, scientists, law enforcement officers, managers, and
            dockworkers-mechanics.</br>

            The founder and active player of the team is Serhiy
            Hrynevetskyi, Head of the Odesa Regional Handball Federation and an Honorary

            During Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the team and its players
            actively engaged in volunteer activities to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

            Despite their prestigious status and age, the players remain constantly active,
            maintaining their training process and achieving new sporting results.</br>

            For the past 10 years, theteam has been a regular finalist in the European Handball Masters
            Championships:

             2015 - Third European Masters Games (Nice, France) - Silver
             2016 - European Handball Masters Championship (Poreč, Croatia) - Gold
             2017 - European Handball Masters Championship (Porto, Portugal) - Gold
             2018 - European Handball Masters Championship (Innsbruck, Austria) - Gold

             2024 - European Handball Masters Championship (Paredes, Portugal) - Gold
            </br>
            The team's goalkeepers, Adil Ozenbishli and Oleh Perekrestov, have repeatedly been
            recognized as the best goalkeepers in European championships.
