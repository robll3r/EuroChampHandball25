          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to meet a team that shows that in handball, as in life, experience is a
            degree (and cold beer, a great incentive). Since 2018, the guys from CD Másters Balonmano Almería have shown
            that passion for the sport has no age... but it is a good excuse to travel, sweat a little and celebrate a
            lot. </br>

            Arriving from different lands in the sunny province of Almería, this group of brave people decided to join
            forces, leaving speed and youthful reflexes aside to concentrate on what is important: enjoying handball
            (and what comes after the game). What better way to keep sporting passion alive than turning each
            championship into an adventure among friends?</br>

            Now heading to the European Championship:
            With luggage full of hope, knee pads (just in case) and some ibuprofen, we headed out to conquer Europe. But
            don't worry, our priorities are clear: </br>

            1. Make friends in every game. </br>
            2. Compete as if we were young (and survive as veterans). </br>
            3. Leave a good taste in your mouth... and bring good stories to tell in Almería! </br>

            In short, the CD Masters Balonmano Almería are more than a team: we are a family, a group of dreamers and,
            above all, a group of friends who never miss an opportunity to show that handball and fun do not understand
            age. See you on the court (or in the third period)!

          <p>In 1981, a group of friends from Banyoles founded the Banyoles Handbol Club, and in the absence of a
            pavilion they also built the playing court in the courtyard of the city institute.</br>
            40 years later, in 2021, the Masters team was formed for the first time to be able to continue enjoying
            handball, with players from the club's entire life but also bringing together people from other clubs in
            Girona where that Masters team did not exist.</br>
            In its first participation in the Catalan Masters League, the team won the title.

            <h2><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LALIN - SPAIN</a></h2>
          </header>
          <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="image fit"><img
              src="../assets/img/teams/LALIN_MEN_35.jpg" alt="" /></a>
          <p>The idea was to create a space where players, who were no longer competing at the federated level, could
            continue enjoying handball, maintain their physical fitness and, above all, strengthen bonds of
            friendship.</br>

            The adventures of the Veterans section began in March 2010 when a series of friendlies were scheduled by
            fifteen former players of the club, thanks to the announcement by the Galician Federation of the possibility
            of creating the Galician Championship through the concentration sector system.</br>

            The first result was a 23-19 victory against Balonmán Ourense de Veteranos.</br>

            As the years passed, the team gained experience in competing in concentration tournaments, becoming a
            benchmark when it came to receiving invitations from other Galician, Asturian and Portuguese teams to
            participate in tournaments in their towns. </br>

            In 2012, the team achieved its first sporting success by winning the Castrillón tournament in Asturias,
            which would be followed by others in Lugo or Bueu and podium positions in Corvera or Ourense.</br>

            The arrival of the pandemic truncated the stability that was achieved over time and at the moment the
            competitive level of the team is being resumed (the fun was never lost) achieving, in recent seasons, once
            again, podium positions in Ribadavia.</br>

            The players and former players are part of the different generations of youth players who have passed
            through the Club and the veterans include in our team, for the dispute of this tournament, all the former
            players who cannot form their own team and want to enjoy the event... Fura Lalín!
