          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to meet a team that shows that in handball, as in life, experience is a
            degree (and cold beer, a great incentive). Since 2018, the guys from CD Másters Balonmano Almería have shown
            that passion for the sport has no age... but it is a good excuse to travel, sweat a little and celebrate a
            lot. </br>

            Arriving from different lands in the sunny province of Almería, this group of brave people decided to join
            forces, leaving speed and youthful reflexes aside to concentrate on what is important: enjoying handball
            (and what comes after the game). What better way to keep sporting passion alive than turning each
            championship into an adventure among friends?</br>

            Now heading to the European Championship:
            With luggage full of hope, knee pads (just in case) and some ibuprofen, we headed out to conquer Europe. But
            don't worry, our priorities are clear: </br>

            1. Make friends in every game. </br>
            2. Compete as if we were young (and survive as veterans). </br>
            3. Leave a good taste in your mouth... and bring good stories to tell in Almería! </br>

            In short, the CD Masters Balonmano Almería are more than a team: we are a family, a group of dreamers and,
            above all, a group of friends who never miss an opportunity to show that handball and fun do not understand
            age. See you on the court (or in the third period)!

          <p>In 1981, a group of friends from Banyoles founded the Banyoles Handbol Club, and in the absence of a
            pavilion they also built the playing court in the courtyard of the city institute.</br>
            40 years later, in 2021, the Masters team was formed for the first time to be able to continue enjoying
            handball, with players from the club's entire life but also bringing together people from other clubs in
            Girona where that Masters team did not exist.</br>
            In its first participation in the Catalan Masters League, the team won the title.

              src="../assets/img/teams/LALIN_MEN_35.jpg" alt="" /></a>
          <p>The idea was to create a space where players, who were no longer competing at the federated level, could
            continue enjoying handball, maintain their physical fitness and, above all, strengthen bonds of
            friendship.</br>

            The adventures of the Veterans section began in March 2010 when a series of friendlies were scheduled by
            fifteen former players of the club, thanks to the announcement by the Galician Federation of the possibility
            of creating the Galician Championship through the concentration sector system.</br>

            The first result was a 23-19 victory against Balonmán Ourense de Veteranos.</br>

            As the years passed, the team gained experience in competing in concentration tournaments, becoming a
            benchmark when it came to receiving invitations from other Galician, Asturian and Portuguese teams to
            participate in tournaments in their towns. </br>

            In 2012, the team achieved its first sporting success by winning the Castrillón tournament in Asturias,
            which would be followed by others in Lugo or Bueu and podium positions in Corvera or Ourense.</br>

            The arrival of the pandemic truncated the stability that was achieved over time and at the moment the
            competitive level of the team is being resumed (the fun was never lost) achieving, in recent seasons, once
            again, podium positions in Ribadavia.</br>

            The players and former players are part of the different generations of youth players who have passed
            through the Club and the veterans include in our team, for the dispute of this tournament, all the former
            players who cannot form their own team and want to enjoy the event... Fura Lalín!

            It began its journey in 1995 with meetings and friendly matches organized by former club players. In 2005,
            the club's veterans legally established themselves as an independent entity and moved to the neighboring
            town of Matadepera, where the Matadepera Veterans Handball Club was founded, comprised solely of one
            handball team, the masters team.</br>

            Handbol Veterans Matadepera quickly established itself as one of the pioneering clubs in the Catalan Masters
            League of the Catalan Handball Federation (FCH). Throughout its history, the club was crowned champion of
            the Catalan Masters League twice: in the 2013-14 and 2015-16 seasons, and also finished runner-up in the
            2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons. He also won the Catalan Masters Cup in the 2007-08 season.</br>

            At the international level, Handbol Veterans Matadepera participated in more than 10 editions of the
            European Masters Handball Championship organized by the EHF (European Masters Handball Championship).</br>

            The club also participated in several national and international friendly tournaments, one of the most
            important being the Ciudad de Sevilla International Tournament, where it always competed in the +35
            category.</br>

            Throughout its recent history, Handbol Veterans Matadepera was primarily comprised of former Handbol
            Terrassa players, which fostered a relationship of friendship and collaboration between the two
            entities.</br>

            This relationship led, in 2021, to a unanimous agreement for all Handbol Veterans Matadepera members to join
            Club Handbol Terrassa.</br>

            Thus, starting in the 2021-2022 season, the veteran team began its journey as Handbol Terrassa Veterans and
            began competing in the Catalan Masters League of the Catalan Handball Federation and other competitions,
            marking the beginning of a new era for veteran handball in the city.

          <p>
            Veteranos BM P.A.N. Moguer started this crazy thing back in 2016. Upon hearing about a veterans' team,
            especially BM Veteranos Sevilla, people from Moguer, mostly former PAN players, said, "Why don't we keep
            enjoying this?" And so it was, here we are.</br>
            The truth is that being a small town, there are years when it's
            hard to field a team (some get injured, others have a lot of respect for it), but we've been going for 10
            years.
            We've also managed to recruit people from Nerva and some from outside. We believe one of the things that
            gets us hooked is playing in tournaments, and not too close together.</br>
            We hope to have a great time at the
            next European Championship, that there are no injuries, and if we can even achieve something, even better.
            Good luck and congratulations to Balonmano Veteranos de Sevilla for holding this European Championship close
            to home so we can enjoy it.</br>

          <p>With the idea of staying united through handball, we created BM Veteranos Malaga in 2019, a group of

            We are currently the veterans section of the Ciudad de Malaga Trops Handball Club, uniting players from all

          <p>The ADEMUR Handball Club began its journey under thame in 2007, marking its 15th anniversary. Prior to this
            name, the Club Balonmano Maristas de La Fuensanta was founded in 1996, which would be more than 25 years
            old.</br>
            After these years of the COVID pandemic, where we have suffered the loss of many players, the club is trying
            to rebuild itself, especially in the youth categories, by embarking on this new and exciting project. We are
            located at the Colegio Maristas de La Fuensanta and have been called Club Balonmano Maristas ADEMUR since
            2014. The goal of establishing ourselves as a club in Murcia is to promote handball at the youth
            levels.</br>
            To this end, we will contact various schools in Murcia and in the surrounding areas to make handball a part
            of children's education, creating schools in different centers so that in the future we will have children
            playing handball at all levels.

            This is the idea behind our group of former handball players who played at the highest level. Driven by the

            European Masters Handball Championship.</br>
            Last year, when we took part for the first time, we finished in a fine 4th place. This year, the excitement
            is growing: there will be two teams representing France in Seville.</br>
            But beyond the results, it's an exceptional human adventure. French players from all over the world, who
            don't always know each other, but who share the same language: that of handball and competition.</br>
            What brings us together above all are the values we share: diversity, sharing, commitment and passing on all
            that the sport has to offer.</br>
            The thrill of playing at the highest level, the excitement of playing together and the passion that unites
